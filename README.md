# Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo 🚀

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model using Google Colab. By following the steps, you'll learn how to upload data, set up fine-tuning parameters, monitor the training process, and test the fine-tuned model.

## 📚 Project Overview

In this project, we go through the following key steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Set up the environment by installing the necessary libraries such as OpenAI and Google Colab integrations.
2. **API Connection**: Learn how to securely connect to the OpenAI API using your API key.
3. **Prepare Data**: Upload and prepare your training and validation data files for fine-tuning.
4. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Start a fine-tuning job using your uploaded data, specifying hyperparameters like epochs and batch size.
5. **Monitor Progress**: Learn how to monitor the fine-tuning job's status and handle interruptions gracefully.
6. **Test the Fine-Tuned Model**: Compare the performance of the fine-tuned model with the base model.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Secure API Integration**: Uses Google Colab's `userdata` module to securely access your OpenAI API key.
- **Automated Fine-Tuning**: Uploads training and validation files to OpenAI's servers for model fine-tuning.
- **Signal Handling**: Handles interruptions in case the Colab runtime is disconnected or the script is stopped.
- **Monitor Training**: Provides a way to track the training job's status and events in real-time.
- **Compare Results**: Test the fine-tuned model and compare its responses with the base model.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Google Colab (for running the notebook)
- OpenAI API key (for accessing the GPT-3.5 Turbo model)
- Google Drive (for storing data files)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine or Google Colab.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to install the required libraries.
3. **Set Up API Key**: Insert your OpenAI API key in the provided section in the notebook.
4. **Prepare Your Data**: Make sure your training and validation data are in JSONL format and upload them to Google Drive.
5. **Run the Notebook**: Follow the instructions in the notebook step-by-step to fine-tune the model.
